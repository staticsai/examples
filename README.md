# Statics Examples

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run a basic website login with Statics using the typescript SDK and React frontend component.

1. Backend Setup
   - Navigate to the backend directory
   - Add STATICS_APIKEY, APP_ID, and targetUrl in the backend src directory
   - Install dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the backend server:
     ```
     npm start
     ```

2. Frontend Setup
   - Open a new terminal window
   - Navigate to the frontend directory
   - Install dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```
     npm start
     ```

3. Access the Application
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by your frontend setup)

Now you should have both the backend and frontend running, and you can interact with the application in your web browser.
The backend console log will show you the result of what is scraped from your targetURL post-login.
